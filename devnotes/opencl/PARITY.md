# Parity results

All comparisons use 16-bit TIFF output and `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1`, because the
multi-threaded CPU path is itself not bit-reproducible (observed up to 5 LSB
difference between two identical runs). The gate is the peak absolute error
(PAE) in normalised units; 1 LSB at 16-bit is 1/65535 = 1.53e-5.

`47c50ee77` changes only CPU export buffer handling; the OpenCL rows above
re-run the existing GPU stages against the new CPU neighbour.
`verify.sh --quick` also re-ran the monitor self-test: max 1 byte, 14 of
196608 samples. The exact CPU export parity for that commit (neutral, sidecar,
sidecar `-f`, both `WorkingTRC` profiles, `AE=0`) is recorded in
`devnotes/perf/FUSION.md`.

`verify.sh` now reports `SKIP` instead of `PASS` when no OpenCL device is
selected, so a CPU-only build cannot produce a vacuous parity claim.

Cross-build check: `WITH_OPENCL=OFF` and `WITH_OPENCL=ON --gpu=off` produced
identical pixels (PAE 0) for the baseline image with `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1`.

Notes:

- `--gpu=off` and `--gpu=auto` on the stub build produce identical pixels.
- Multi-threaded runs of the same binary differ by up to 5 LSB, so CPU
  regression tests must either pin `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1` or allow that
  tolerance. This is a pre-existing RawTherapee characteristic, not an OpenCL
  effect.
- The TIFF files still differ byte-wise because of embedded timestamps; do not
  use SHA-256 of the file as a gate.
- Output conversion is compared only for the shipped `RTv4_sRGB` profile and
  8/16-bit integer output. Other profiles and float output continue to use
  lcms and are pixel-identical between `--gpu=off` and `--gpu=auto`.
- `compare_tiff.py` now normalises through ImageMagick to uncompressed 16-bit
  TIFF and reads the encoded samples. The previous ImageMagick `rgb:` path
  linearised the samples, which amplified a 1 LSB difference into a 26 LSB
  PAE.
- Monitor output is 8-bit, so its parity gate is 1 byte. `verify.sh --quick`
  and `verify.sh --monitor` run `rawtherapee-cli --gpu-test-monitor`, which
  compares the GPU monitor conversion with lcms on a deterministic 256×256
  full-range Lab image.
- `verify.sh --rgbproc` sets `RT_OPENCL_RGBPROC=1`, asserts that
  `opencl rgbproc:` ran, and compares neutral and exposure profiles. The
  stage is batch-only because preview supplies a tone-curve histogram.
